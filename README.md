It aims to be simple, so the user is not distracted from whats important -
**getting stuff done**.

## Tasks

Tasks are why the user is here.
They are the main purpose of the application.
A Task is made up of the following attributes:

* title - ___Required___
* date completed
* description
* date due

Tasks can be created, viewed, and completed.

### Creating a Task

Tasks are created by pressing the New Task button.
A Title is all that is required for a Task to be made.
Upon task creation, the task is added to the task list.

```psudocode
New Task button is touched
  User enters a Title
  User enters a Due Date
  User enters a Description
  User confirms
    create a new Task

    if the User provided a due date
      set the new Task's due date to the User input
    if the User provided a description
      set the new Task's description to the User input

    if the user provided a title
      set the new Task's title to the User input
      add the new Task to the Task List
    else
      cancel task creation
      show Toast saying a title is required
```

### Viewing a Task

While a task can be viewed on the main screen, there may be times where a user wants to see more about the task.
This allows the user to view full descriptions in the case of truncated text.

```psudocode
User touches the View Task button
  display/overlay View Task Activity(Fragment)
  display task title
  if task has a description
    display it
  if task has a due date
    display it
  if the task is completed
    display the completion date
```

### Completing a Task

Tasks are completed by touching the Task Status checkbox.
This changes the task date completed field to the current date.
If the user wants to un-complete a task, the user touoch the Task Status checkbox again, which would remove the completed date field.

```psudocode
User touches the Task Status checkbox
  if task is currently completed
    set the completed date to null
  otherwise
    set the completed date to today

render the checkmark accordingly
```
